PyFiddler is a python script http proxy and looks like the Fiddler.

it can sniffer and log all http request and response, and can block and modify data in that console.

```shell
    python fiddler.py
```
the proxy will listen at port 0.0.0.0:8888 by default.
and the console running at 0.0.0.0:8889.

try it and fork it :-p
